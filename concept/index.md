## Preface 

> As all historians know, the past is a great darkness, and filled with echoes.
Voices may reach us from it; but what they say to us is imbued with the obscurity of the matrix out of which they come; and, try as we may, we cannot decipher them precisely in the clearer light of our own day.

> Nature even on the most local scales made a mockery of information technology. Even augmented by tech, the human brain was paltry, infinitesimal, in comparision to the universe. [...] Matter was information, information matter, and only in the brain did matter organize itself sufficiently to be aware of itself; only in the brain could the information of which the world consisted manipulate itself. The human brain was a very special case.

> When the shadow of the sash appeared on the curtains it was between seven and
eight o’clock and then I was in time again, hearing the watch. It was Grandfather’s and when Father gave it to me he said, Quentin, I give you the mausoleum of all hope and desire; it’s rather excruciatingly apt that you will use it to gain the reducto absurdum of all human experience which fit your individual needs no better than it fitted his or his father’s. I give it to you not that you may remember time, but that you might forget it now and then for a moment and not spend all your breath trying to conquer it. Because no battle is ever won he said. They are not even fought. The field only reveals to man his own folly and despair,
and victory is an illusion of philosophers and fools.

## Introduction

## Duration

In the first section I described how clock time is the paradigm by which we organize our daily life. Clocks provide one distinct measurement of time and a common convention by which one can interact with reality. But it also imposes a contradiction upon us: between external time and our individual internal perception of time. As I pointed out before this asynchronicity between external and internal time is problematic because it skews the reality of time as we experience it. And it also hints towards the idea that clock time has very little to do with the actual nature of time.

Coming from a theoretical point of view Henri Bergson describes our reality of time as fixed moments juxtaposed to another. It is this concept of incremental progression of time which Henri Bergson approaches in his essay ‘La pensee et le mouvant’ (1934), that was translated in ‘The Creative Mind’ (1946). He describes these moments in time as virtual points of rest. According to Bergson this notion of time is scientific and excises only repetition and predictability from our material reality. It puts space and time on the same plane, so we deduce our knowledge about time from our observations about the nature and functions of space. And although he admits that this common sense notion of time is a requirement for our communal life he also perceives it as the reason for our relative awareness about time.

> Spatiality therefore, and in this quite special sense, sociability, are in this case the real causes of the relativity of our knowledge. Brushing aside this veil, we get back to the immediate and reach an absolute.
>
> Bergson, p.28

Bergson’s quest to reach an ‘immediate’ and ‘absolute’ notion of time is by gaining an understanding of its duration. To him duration is not a slice of time but rather an ongoing, never-ending process. He explains his concept of duration by the means of the two measures that shape it: movement and change. According to Bergson our notion of movement is based on fixed points, moments extracted from time, which describe motions in space. We perceive moment A where something is happening now, and by defining moment B where it was, we are enabled to extrapolate into the future moment C where it will be. The juxtaposition of these moments then resemble movement. But to Bergson this juxtaposition is an artificial recomposition of movement swayed by the exigencies of language and computation. The same is true for change. For him change is not the snapshots of states along the course of its happening; “on the contrary, it is flux, the continuity of transition, it is change itself that is real.” (Bergson, p.15) So, if the components movement and duration are indivisible, even substantial, than the same must be true for duration.

> Nevertheless the conviction still persists that even if it has not been conceived before being produced, it could have been, and in this sense from all eternity it has existed as possible, in some real or virtual intelligence. The examining of this illusion should tell us that it results from the very essence of our understanding.
>
> Bergson, p.21

Therefore Bergson argues that our common illusion about the nature of the time leads to logic of retrospection. This logic neglects the immediacy and autonomy of the moment. Instead the present moment casts a shadow into the past where reality of now already existed as a possibility. But not only does our unwillingness to accept that our reality emerges in the moment reduce the present to the mere possible preexistent in the past. By anchoring the present to the past we claim to anticipate the future—as if reality sits on a predefined line protruding from the past into the future. This logic completely negates that time is efficacious. Time is not a linear vector but rather an ongoing force in an indefinite system.

As Cliff Stagoll points out in his essays on Becoming and Duration in Adrian Parr’s The Deleuze Dictionary (2010) Gilles Deleuze bases his notion of difference and becoming on Bergson’s notion of duration in addition to Bergson’s method of philosophical intuition. According to Deleuze intuition reveals the essential temporal qualities of our consciousness. An ongoing mental activity that constitutes “a time internal to one’s self.” (Parr, p.81) As this might be simply interpreted as a reference of the common conception of internal time, Deleuze further argues that difference and becoming are key elements of life and essential to one’s lived experience.

According to Deleuze every moment is a productive assemblage of forces of ‘becoming different’. The present moment has no ties to the past or the future in that every event occurs in a continuous flow with neither a known start-point nor a specific end-point. Thereby Deleuze acknowledges the efficacious qualities of time. In other words, nature’s continual flow of changes is the immanent production of every unique event. Therefore “becoming might be conceived as the eternal, productive return of difference.” (p.26) This process is the anchor point for Deleuze to argue that changes occur and unfold in their own time – the pure time or empty time.

Further Deleuze agrees with Bergson on the simultaneous awareness of the flow of changes and the particular differences and relationships. So within the steady flow of changes we are able to pinpoint distinct states. But by perceiving them in union Deleuze posits the creative potential that lies in the disconnection between these events.

> Even in the continuity of one’s consciousness, there is a disconnection between events that allows creativity and renewal.
>
> Parr, p.82

Henri Bergson describes our reality as a creative evolution, where novelty is constantly springing forth and where “continuous phases penetrate one another by a kind of internal growth.” (Bergson, p.19) This notion of duration, and thereby time itself, enables a reality that is radically different from our common perception. Ultimately Bergson is not appealing to give up on our logical approach towards time. But even if pure intuition is not replacement to our common notion of time, an extended understanding of duration enables creative solutions to ‘big problems’. Bergson posits that the struggle with problems is caused by the detached skin of time which we falsely  perceived as its equivalent. By restoring the awareness of the fluidity of duration and the change and difference inherent to the flow of time we grasp the chance for creative and novel evolution.

> Let us say then, that in duration, considered as a creative evolution, there is perpetual creation of possibility and not only of reality.
>
> Bergson, p.20

The ideas by Bergson and Deleuze have many revolutionary implications – politically, socially and personally. If we try to perceive time in the proposed manner oneself has to raise questions of being and identity. If things and states are viewed in the field of forces of time, as products of becoming, then the human subject seems utterly lost and without impact.

## Emergence

Bergson's interpretation of an understanding of time based on duration has inherent emergent characteristics. His notion of internal growth and constant creation of novelty aligns with the concepts encapsulated in **emergence**. Emergence is a much debated topic with little consensus about its definition. Nevertheless it is a worthwhile endevour to inspect the characteristics of emergence in regards to time.

As the 2008 edition of the [Chicago Humanities Festival](http://chicagohumanities.org/) addressed it – [*Emergence: Where Science Meets Philosophy*](http://chicagohumanities.org/events/2008/thinking-big/emergence-philosophy-meets-science) – the field lies at a vibrant intersection. Science and philosophy identify similiar but also different properties that characterize emergence...

In his essay *'The mangle in practice'* Andrew Pickering suggests an alternative perception of scientific practice/s... He proposes a performative notion which acknowledges the **temporally emergent relationship between human and nonhuman agency**. Thereby his idea extends the default conception of science-as-knowledge to represent nature and produce insights. The concept of science-as-culture includes material, social and temporal dimensions.

By acknowledging the symmetric nature of human and nonhuman agency, Pickering ties himself to the **actor-network theory** proposed by Bruno Latour among others. Whereas he agrees with the feature of material agency in order to escape the representational nature of science in favor of a performative nature, Pickering opposes Latour's appeal to semiotics in order to justify his theory to critics. According to Pickering semiotics bears the risk of underrating human agency and therefore all knowledge produced by science. This is why he proposes the temporally emergent property of human and nonhuman agency. Another effect of performing science in real time is that it resolves the issue of retrospective justification. Instead retrospection itself becomes subject to analysis.

Pickering's deviation from the actor-network theory is founded in human **intentionality**. Intentionality captures goals of nonexistent future states that humans seek out to achieve. By acknowledging the itention of human agency he objects to a purely symmetric relationship with nonhuman agency. In this regard Pickering agrees with Latour's critics who resolves this issue simply by the means of semiotics. But according to Pickering this clearly disregards the extended temporality of human intentionality. Therefore he proposes the process of **modelling**. This open-ended process has neither a determinate destination nor a finite number of instrumental variants. The goals of scientific practice emerge in real time.

> Existing culture, to appropriate Michel Foucault's phrase (1972), is literally the surface of emergence for the intentional structure of human agency.
> 
> Pickering, p.20

Further Pickering remarks that based on the assumption that goals of scientific practice emerge from existing machines, material agency and human itentions must be intertwined. This dependency he describes as the process of **tuning**. Tuning is a process in which humans intentionally make adjustments to machines in anticipation of a specific result which is a capture of material agency. 'The world of intentionality is, then, constitutively engaged with the world of material agency, even if the one cannot be substituted for the other.' (p.20) Not only is the relationship between human and material agency required but also the scientific goals liable for revision. In the process of tuning human intention is reconfigured and becomes itself subject to temporal emergence. Therefore human intentionality and nonhuman agency are deeply intertwined by reciprocal dependence. Nevertheless human intent is still acknowledged as distinct.

> Tuning in goal-oriented practice takes the form, I think, of a dance of agency.
> 
> Pickering, p.21

The dance of agency alludes to performative idiom Pickering tries to establish in quite literal way. The previously described process of tuning can be generalized as a form of a **dialectic of resistance and accommodation**. In this case resistence is a metaphor for failing to achieve an intended capture of material agency. On the other hand accomodation is an active human strategy as a result of resistance. This interplay of material and social agency blurs their contours. It is this emergent transformation and delineation which Pickering appropriates as 'the mangle in practice'. By corroding the distinctions between human and nonhuman agency the mangle adverts to actor-network theory. But the performative idiom that Pickering developed moves past binary distinctions between humanism and antihumanism. Instead it opens the space for **posthumanism**. In it human actors are still present but also inextricably entangled with the nonhuman. Humans simply lost their claim of being at the center of reality.

> The world makes us in one and the same process as we make the world.

## Conclusion

How unstable out image of reality actually is was recently exposed with the Higgs Boson Particle by the LHC. The proof that this particle exists was attributed by measurements of its weight. This result does not align with two dominant theoretical physic views of our universe. The multiverse and {...}. The calculations of the former we made under the assumtion that the Higgs Boson particle weighs {...}. The latter theory assumed that the same particle weighs {...}. The actual result turned out to be {...}.

Neri Oxman depicts in her inaugural essay [*'Age of Entanglement'*](http://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/AgeOfEntanglement) for the [Journal of Design and Science (JoDS)](http://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/) the fields of science and art adjacent to one another. They meet each other in philosophy, where according to Oxman cuture and nature are debated in order to derive new information.
