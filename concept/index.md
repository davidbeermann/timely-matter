> As all historians know, the past is a great darkness, and filled with echoes.
Voices may reach us from it; but what they say to us is imbued with the obscurity of the matrix out of which they come; and, try as we may, we cannot decipher them precisely in the clearer light of our own day.

> When the shadow of the sash appeared on the curtains it was between seven and
eight o’clock and then I was in time again, hearing the watch. It was Grandfather’s and when Father gave it to me he said, Quentin, I give you the mausoleum of all hope and desire; it’s rather excruciatingly apt that you will use it to gain the reducto absurdum of all human experience which fit your individual needs no better than it fitted his or his father’s. I give it to you not that you may remember time, but that you might forget it now and then for a moment and not spend all your breath trying to conquer it. Because no battle is ever won he said. They are not even fought. The field only reveals to man his own folly and despair,
and victory is an illusion of philosophers and fools.

## Introduction

## Duration

In the first section I described how clock time is the paradigm by which we organize our daily life. Clocks provide one distinct measurement of time and a common convention by which one can interact with reality. But it also imposes a contradiction upon us: between external time and our individual internal perception of time. As I pointed out before this asynchronicity between external and internal time is problematic because it skews the reality of time as we experience it. And it also hints towards the idea that clock time has very little to do with the actual nature of time.

Coming from a theoretical point of view Henri Bergson describes our reality of time as fixed moments juxtaposed to another. It is this concept of incremental progression of time which Henri Bergson approaches in his essay ‘La pensee et le mouvant’ (1934), that was translated in ‘The Creative Mind’ (1946). He describes these moments in time as virtual points of rest. According to Bergson this notion of time is scientific and excises only repetition and predictability from our material reality. It puts space and time on the same plane, so we deduce our knowledge about time from our observations about the nature and functions of space. And although he admits that this common sense notion of time is a requirement for our communal life he also perceives it as the reason for our relative awareness about time.

> Spatiality therefore, and in this quite special sense, sociability, are in this case the real causes of the relativity of our knowledge. Brushing aside this veil, we get back to the immediate and reach an absolute.
>
> Bergson, p.28

Bergson’s quest to reach an ‘immediate’ and ‘absolute’ notion of time is by gaining an understanding of its duration. To him duration is not a slice of time but rather an ongoing, never-ending process. He explains his concept of duration by the means of the two measures that shape it: movement and change. According to Bergson our notion of movement is based on fixed points, moments extracted from time, which describe motions in space. We perceive moment A where something is happening now, and by defining moment B where it was, we are enabled to extrapolate into the future moment C where it will be. The juxtaposition of these moments then resemble movement. But to Bergson this juxtaposition is an artificial recomposition of movement swayed by the exigencies of language and computation. The same is true for change. For him change is not the snapshots of states along the course of its happening; “on the contrary, it is flux, the continuity of transition, it is change itself that is real.” (Bergson, p.15) So, if the components movement and duration are indivisible, even substantial, than the same must be true for duration.

> Nevertheless the conviction still persists that even if it has not been conceived before being produced, it could have been, and in this sense from all eternity it has existed as possible, in some real or virtual intelligence. The examining of this illusion should tell us that it results from the very essence of our understanding.

> Bergson, p.21

Therefore Bergson argues that our common illusion about the nature of the time leads to logic of retrospection. This logic neglects the immediacy and autonomy of the moment. Instead the present moment casts a shadow into the past where reality of now already existed as a possibility. But not only does our unwillingness to accept that our reality emerges in the moment reduce the present to the mere possible preexistent in the past. By anchoring the present to the past we claim to anticipate the future—as if reality sits on a predefined line protruding from the past into the future. This logic completely negates that time is efficacious. Time is not a linear vector but rather an ongoing force in an indefinite system.

As Cliff Stagoll points out in his essays on Becoming and Duration in Adrian Parr’s The Deleuze Dictionary (2010) Gilles Deleuze bases his notion of difference and becoming on Bergson’s notion of duration in addition to Bergson’s method of philosophical intuition. According to Deleuze intuition reveals the essential temporal qualities of our consciousness. An ongoing mental activity that constitutes “a time internal to one’s self.” (Parr, p.81) As this might be simply interpreted as a reference of the common conception of internal time, Deleuze further argues that difference and becoming are key elements of life and essential to one’s lived experience.

According to Deleuze every moment is a productive assemblage of forces of ‘becoming different’. The present moment has no ties to the past or the future in that every event occurs in a continuous flow with neither a known start-point nor a specific end-point. Thereby Deleuze acknowledges the efficacious qualities of time. In other words, nature’s continual flow of changes is the immanent production of every unique event. Therefore “becoming might be conceived as the eternal, productive return of difference.” (p.26) This process is the anchor point for Deleuze to argue that changes occur and unfold in their own time – the pure time or empty time.

Further Deleuze agrees with Bergson on the simultaneous awareness of the flow of changes and the particular differences and relationships. So within the steady flow of changes we are able to pinpoint distinct states. But by perceiving them in union Deleuze posits the creative potential that lies in the disconnection between these events.

> Even in the continuity of one’s consciousness, there is a disconnection between events that allows creativity and renewal.
>
> Parr, p.82

Henri Bergson describes our reality as a creative evolution, where novelty is constantly springing forth and where “continuous phases penetrate one another by a kind of internal growth.” (Bergson, p.19) This notion of duration, and thereby time itself, enables a reality that is radically different from our common perception. Ultimately Bergson is not appealing to give up on our logical approach towards time. But even if pure intuition is not replacement to our common notion of time, an extended understanding of duration enables creative solutions to ‘big problems’. Bergson posits that the struggle with problems is caused by the detached skin of time which we falsely  perceived as its equivalent. By restoring the awareness of the fluidity of duration and the change and difference inherent to the flow of time we grasp the chance for creative and novel evolution.

> Let us say then, that in duration, considered as a creative evolution, there is perpetual creation of possibility and not only of reality.
>
> Bergson, p.20

The ideas by Bergson and Deleuze have many revolutionary implications – politically, socially and personally. If we try to perceive time in the proposed manner oneself has to raise questions of being and identity. If things and states are viewed in the field of forces of time, as products of becoming, then the human subject seems utterly lost and without impact.
