# Ideation

Unfortunately with release v0.9.0 of Cinder the sample code of the tutorial was removed from the download. But for reference it is still available with older releases. Head of to Cinder's [Download](https://libcinder.org/download) page and download the release v0.8.6. Once unpackaged inside the relase folder you'll find a folder named tour which contains the original tutorial in HTML and also the source code for each chapter.
