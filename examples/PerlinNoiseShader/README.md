# Perlin Noise Shader Example

The shaders are written in GLSL 1.5 for OpenGL 3.2. Download [OpenGL Extension Viewer](http://www.realtech-vr.com/glview/) to verify support on your system.

The GLSL Perlin Noise implementation is taken from Stefan Gustavson's [WebGL Noise](https://github.com/stegu/webgl-noise) repository. His code is licensed under MIT.
