# 2D Metaballs

This example uses the [marching squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_squares) algorithm to draw the [isolines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contour_line) formed by the elements of a particle system.

It was inspired by [aa_debdeb](https://www.openprocessing.org/user/51764)'s [metaballs sketch](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/375385) on [OpenProcessing](https://www.openprocessing.org/).
