This website documents my master thesis project *Timely Matter* realized in the summer term 2016 in the [Digital Media department](http://digitalmedia-bremen.de/) at the [University of the Arts Bremen](http://www.hfk-bremen.de/en). 

The project is a reflection upon the understanding of time and how technology influences it. Within this broad scope the project pinpoints how time is related to matter, the implications of this relationship and therefrom derived the possible new approaches towards a different uderstanding of time and technology.
