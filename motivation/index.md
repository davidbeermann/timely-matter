# Motivation

The topic of this project was motivated by several encounters. Firstly it was inspired by my personal endeavour managing time by the means of computers. Secondly it was motivated by my increasing interest in how modern technology is affecting us personally and sociologically. And lastly it was influenced by my interest in the nature of time from a scientific perspective. These three strands culminated in the theme *Experiments on the entanglements of technology, time and the present moment*.

Although my topic is rooted in theoretical observations I set myself the goal to produce *experiments*. By that I mean the practical exploration and application within a theoretical context. The goal of these experiments was not so much a tangible visualization of a theoretical ideas, but rather to create a relevant experience inspired by these ideas. The choice for the very broad context of *technology* and *time* was also a conscious decision. The constantly evolving technological landscape creates new applications in multiple forms. Focusing simply on computers or smartphones would have being an artificial limitation. In a similiar fashion this argument is also true for time itself. Which leaves us the only particular notion within the topic, the *present moment*. As I'll try to show with my work, I believe the present moment is crucial in understanding and approaching current and new conceptions of time in general. Namely Henri Bergson's notion of duration was elemental for me in developing a different stance on time and in turn directing my further research and the development of my thesis project.

## Core themes

While converging my initial instinct within the broad field I defined for myself into a concrete topic I identified several themes, which I believe are relevant in the context of my thesis topic. Even if not all aspects mentioned below found their way into the final concept of my work, they were at the back of my mind while working on it. In the following paragraphs I'd like to introduce these crucial themes.

### Efficiency

Nowadays modern computer technology provides a multiplicity of options providing help to organize ones time. In its simplest form it appers as calendars, notifications and timers. Build upon these are a number of strategies, for example: [GTD (Getting Things Done)](http://gettingthingsdone.com/), [Pomodoro Technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/) or the [Eisenhower Matrix](http://www.eisenhower.me/). The techniques a then translated into software which makes them broadly available and oftentimes feasible. 

All these techniques aim to accomplish higher efficiency in order to 'save time'. The notion of 'saving time' alludes to notion of a sustainable work-life balance. The goal is to minimize the amount of 'work time' in order to gain 'life time'. In this scenario work and life are two competing forces, where work has a negative connotation, whereas life has positive connotations. From this perspective being effective at work is eligible, if not necessary in order to have time for life.

Generally technology that acts as a enhancement of or replacement for human labor is ingrained with the drive for efficiency. It is the promise to tilt the scale towards the life part of the equation. Computers especially try to fulfill the promise of less, more efficient work. Once computers where connected by a world-wide network and services became available detached from space, the dream of 'efficiency at the click of a mouse' was attainable, as this [early commercial by AOL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1npzZu83AfU) emphasizes.

Even when taking the commercial with a grain of salt I think it is worth asking how did we gain comparatively such an advantage in efficiency due to computers but somehow lacking the projected gains in time. If any theme is pravailing over the last few years, if not decades, than the perceived lack of time which we are trying to solve with ever more innovations – technological or enabled by technology. Are we stuck in cycle of efficiency which itself reaps the gains in time?

### Acceleration

Following the arguments about efficiency one might think that acceleration allures to the speed of technology and its speed at which it evolved over the past decades and continues in the same vein. There's no doubt that the pace of change is part of the phenomenon. In his famous paper from 1965 Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, proposed a model which predicted a doubling of transistor density in computer chips each for the next decade. The density of transistors are an indicator for computational processing speed. And although he adjusted his proposal in 1975 to two years for the doubling rate, his predictions proved to be very acurate. Nowadays we refer to this rate of technological progress as [Moore's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law), since it proved as a valid model not just for the speed of computer processors. Today the impact of Moore's law is accepted as the driving force of change in technology and society.

Even if in retrospect Moore's predictions proved to be acurate, when released it must have seem unlikely to continue for decades. To the extend that today we are faced with supercomputers and artificial intelligence algoritms that operate beyond any human understanding. A good indicator for this claim is what has become known as ['Flash Crash'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Flash_Crash) which happened in 2010. It started on May 6th at 2:32 p.m. and lasted for approximately 36 minutes. Due to High-frequency trading stock indices plummeted and rebounded rapidly at an erratic rate and stock values became unhinged from their underlying value. A few years later these kinds of crashes we accepted as not just singular incidents but could also be predicted. In order to understand the frenzy of automated trading the design studio [Stamen](http://stamen.com/) has visualized a day's worth of trading data from the NASDAQ stock exchange in their project [A Day of Financial Transactions](http://stamen.com/work/a-day-of-financial-transactions/). **{TODO find reference to design book with visualisations on stock trading incidents due to automation}**

Although the story that technology is causing the acceleration seems plausible, Judy Wacjman is proposing a different narrative. In her book 'Pressed for Time: The Acceleration of Life in Digital Capitalism' she describes acceleration as a cult, that is defined by social factors and not just technology alone. ...

Tightly coupled with efficiency is the perceived acceleration of life in general and time specifically. As pointed out by several writers and sociologists ...

### Relativity

The way we experience time is two-fold. On the one hand there is external time, or clock time, which structures our interaction with our environment. The contrast to that is internal time, which describes how we actually experience the flow of time. Whereas external time is linear, internal time is non-linear. We expereice this fact when in certain moments time seems to stand still, whereas in other moments time seems faster than usual. The experience of time is coupled to our psyche ...

### Appropriation

Appropriation of technological functionalities as human paradigms i.e. multi-tasking ...

### Encoding

... I think, when thoughts, ideas and philosophies are encoded into software their sociological exposure and long-term effects should be closely monitored and carefully analyzed. ...

## Cognitive Dissonance

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance

> It sounds like such a weirdly scientific term, but it’s broad reaching. I guess, for me, I was thinking about a place—because of the Internet—where there’s a lot of information out there, and we’re constantly bombarded by it, and it’s telling us many different things. Some of them are true, some of them are not. Some of them are true temporarily, and then change as science progresses. It’s just a mess of information. I think inherently, most people want to be good people, and being bombarded by all this is pushing them and pulling them in a bunch of different directions. You start to kind of lose touch with yourself by gaining all of this information. I think that’s where some of the dissonance comes from—wanting to do the right thing, but losing track of what that is for you as a human being.
