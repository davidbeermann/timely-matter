# Motivation

The topic of this project was motivated by several encounters. Firstly it was inspired by my personal endeavour managing time by the means of computers. Secondly it was motivated by my increasing interest in how modern technology is affecting us personally and sociologically. And lastly it was influenced by my interest in the nature of time from a scientific perspective. These three strands culminated in the theme *Experiments on the entanglements of technology, time and the present moment*.

Although my topic is rooted in theoretical observations I set myself the goal to produce *experiments*. By that I mean the practical exploration and application within a theoretical context. The goal of these experiments was not so much a tangible visualization of a theoretical ideas, but rather to create a relevant experience inspired by these ideas. The choice for the very broad context of *technology* and *time* was also a conscious decision. The constantly evolving technological landscape creates new applications in multiple forms. Focusing simply on computers or smartphones would have being an artificial limitation. In a similiar fashion this argument is also true for time itself. Which leaves us the only particular notion within the topic, the *present moment*. As I'll try to show with my work, I believe the present moment is crucial in understanding and approaching current and new conceptions of time in general. Namely Henri Bergson's notion of duration was elemental for me in developing a different stance on time and in turn directing my further research and the development of my thesis project.

## Core themes

> "Nobody understands time." — Lisa Randall, Theoretical Physicist

While converging my initial instinct within the broad field I defined for myself into a concrete topic I identified several themes, which I believe are relevant in the context of my thesis topic. Even if not all aspects mentioned below found their way into the final concept of my work, they were at the back of my mind while working on it. In the following paragraphs I'd like to introduce these crucial themes.

### Efficiency

During the financial crisis which started in 2007 and which is recognized as the worst financial crisis since the great depression of the 1930s one name was frequently mentioned: economist John Maynard Keynes. Among his macroeconomic concepts he advocated for a mixed economy where the private sector is predominant, but at times of recession the public sector should intervene. The concepts outlined in his 1936 book *The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money.* are commonly refered to as *Keynesianism*. Apart from the resurgence of his ideas at times of crisis another prediction of Keynes is worth mentioning. According to his forecast technological progress might create a 15-hour workweek by 2030. In other words he assumed that the gains in technological efficiency would free people from work.

The idea of "The End of Work" is nothing new, even at Keynes' times. It is floating around for at least 200 years, as economist and director of the Initiative on the Digital Economy at MIT Andrew McAfee points out in his [interview on Christopher Lydon's Open Source Radio show](http://radioopensource.org/the-end-of-work/). According to McAfee we are living at times of the second industrial revolution. Whereas in the first revolution we overcame the limitations of our muscles, in the second revolution we will be overcoming the limitations of our minds. The ultimate goal remains the utilization of machines in order to take over the menial tasks of everyday life, so we as humans can immerse ourselves in our passions. In his book *The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies.* he calls this state *Digital Athens*. By this he's referring to greeks time of high culture which was characterized by humanist ideals. A reference which I will pick up on later.

Although the ideal of the end of work sounds tempting, McAfee goes on to explain why in his opinion we should critically observe the transition period. The classic economist view of the world is that technology creates more jobs and companies than it destroys. But through his research he became sceptical of this assumption. Because he observed how technology is the driving factor of hollowing out the middle class. That is because technology creates new jobs at the upper and lower steps of the skill ladder. 

> "We all remember the promises. The slogans. They were all about freedom, liberation. Supposedly we were in handcuffs and wanted out of them. The key that dangled in front of us was a microchip." — Walter Kirn

Generally technology which enables higher efficency does so in order to save time – doing the same amount of work in less time. The notion of 'saving time' also alludes to notion of a sustainable work-life balance. The goal is to minimize the amount of 'work time' in order to gain 'life time'. In this scenario work and life are two competing forces, where work has a negative connotation, whereas life has positive connotations. From this perspective being effective at work is eligible, if not necessary in order to have 'time to live'. Generally, technology that acts as a enhancement of or replacement for human labor is ingrained with the drive for efficiency. It is the promise to tip the scale towards the life part of the equation. Computers especially try to fulfill the promise of less, more efficient work. Once computers where connected by a world-wide network and services became available detached from space and time, the dream of 'efficiency at the click of a mouse' seemed attainable even more so.

As I will point out later the notion of saving time also alludes to a materiality of time, af if time could be stored and used at a later point. This idea is core around which the famous children story of *Momo* by Michael Ende revolves.

Unquestionably technology is evolving at a rapid pace compared to previous decades. How did we gain comparatively such an advantage in efficiency due to computers but somehow lack the projected gains in time? If any theme is pravailing over the last few years, if not decades, than the perceived lack of time which we are trying to solve with ever more innovations – technological or enabled by technology. Are we stuck in cycle of efficiency which itself reaps the gains in time? Is the end of work a utopia?

### Acceleration

Following the arguments about efficiency one might think that acceleration alludes to the speed of technology and its speed at which it evolved over the past decades and continues in the same vein. There's no doubt that the pace of change is part of the phenomenon. In his famous paper from 1965 Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, proposed a model which predicted a doubling of transistor density in computer chips each for the next decade. The density of transistors are an indicator for computational processing speed. And although he adjusted his proposal in 1975 to two years for the doubling rate, his predictions proved to be very acurate. Nowadays we refer to this rate of technological progress as [Moore's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law), since it proved as a valid model not just for the speed of computer processors. Today the impact of Moore's law is accepted as the driving force of change in technology and society.

Even if in retrospect Moore's predictions proved to be acurate, when released it must have seem unlikely to continue for decades. To the extend that today we are faced with supercomputers and artificial intelligence algoritms that operate beyond any human understanding. A good indicator for this claim is what has become known as ['Flash Crash'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Flash_Crash) which happened in 2010. It started on May 6th at 2:32 p.m. and lasted for approximately 36 minutes. Due to High-frequency trading stock indices plummeted and rebounded rapidly at an erratic rate and stock values became unhinged from their underlying value. A few years later these kinds of crashes we accepted as not just singular incidents but could also be predicted. In order to understand the frenzy of algorithmic trading the design studio [Stamen](http://stamen.com/) has visualized a day's worth of trading data from the NASDAQ stock exchange in their project [A Day of Financial Transactions](http://stamen.com/work/a-day-of-financial-transactions/). Another interesting visual project in this context is the collaboration between [Bernhard Hopfengärtner](http://berndhopfengaertner.net/) and [Gunnar Green](http://www.thegreeneyl.com/) for [75000 Futures](http://berndhopfengaertner.net/projects/75000-futures/).

Although the story that technology is causing the acceleration seems plausible, Judy Wacjman is proposing a different narrative. In her book [*Pressed for Time: The Acceleration of Life in Digital Capitalism*](http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/P/bo19085612.html) she describes acceleration as a cult, that is defined by social factors and not just by technology alone. She argues that "the symbolic significance and allure of speed that characterize our present condition has a long lineage". She even traces this lineage back to Georg Simmel's essay *The Metropolis and Mental Life* from 1903. She agrees with Simmel in that immediacy, simultaneity, and presentism have been there since the industrialization. So, what makes the difference today?

Following Wacjman the reason is the intensification of work enabled by technology. The idea of the intensification of work is derived from Karl Marx, who argued that there are only two ways to extract more work from laborers: work longer hours or increase the productivity in the same period of time. According to Wajcman's empirical research work hours have remained constant since the 1960s. But her research also shows that a feeling of contant pressure and lack of time has evolved. Why did this gap emerge? Wajcman's answer is two-fold. On the one hand there are people who work more by choice and others who work less unintendedly. The distribution of work is very unequal across our societies. Wajcman also argues that the gap is caused by the strain of a new **performance regime**. Our work is measured in ways it was never before.

> "We now attribute value to “busyness” and multitasking; we feel busy because we want to squeeze as much as possible into as little time as possible. In order to change these feelings we first need to redefine our cultural values." — Judy Wacjman

So in essence technology is not innately responsible for our lack of time. It is rather our cultural inclinination to perform and feel busy. And the compression of time due to performance induced by technology fuels the acceleration narrative. Nevertheless, Wajcman says about herself that she does not fall prey to cultural pessimism or technological determinism which she is critizing Paul Virilio and Manuel Castels for. She's optimistic that after using new technologies excessively and obsessively in the beginning over time we integrate the new tools into our lives.

### Relativity

The way we experience time is two-fold. On the one hand there is external time, or clock time, which structures our interaction with our environment. The contrast to that is internal time, which describes how we actually experience the flow of time. Whereas external time is linear, internal time is non-linear. We expereice this fact when in certain moments time seems to stand still, whereas in other moments time seems faster than usual. The experience of time is coupled to our psyche ...

### Appropriation

Derived from the ideal of efficency we developed strategies which appropriate technological functionalities as human paradigms. To name a few: Multi-Tasking, Browsing, Life-Hacking. But once you lift the curtain on these paradigms it is revealed that these ideas oftentimes do not work in our favor, if not against us. Take for example multi-tasking. Within the computer multi-tasking is a concept to split up a computational task into multiple processes in order to handled concurrently by multiple processors or processor cores in a single processor. The principle of splitting tasks into smaller chunks can also be found in to-do lists, for example GTD. But executing tasks simultaneously is different.

As pointed out by Walter Kirn in his 2007 article [*The Autumn of the Multitaskers*](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2007/11/the-autumn-of-the-multitaskers/306342/) scientists found evidence contrasting the assumed benefits of multi-tasking. First of all it requires a constant switching between brain regions – imagine reading an article (visual process) and brushing your teeth (physical coordination). This switching actually prevents the activation of higher areas of brain activity which are related to memory and learning. "We concentrate on the act of concentration at the expense of whatever it is that we’re supposed to be concentrating *on*". Further there is evidence that multi-tasking triggers biochemical processes which release stress related hormones. Although the effect of these hormones in the short term are controversial – some even argue for them to be healthy – science univocally agrees on the long term effects of stress in general and related hormones. Effects are fatigue, inability to focus and limited analytical abilities. "This is the great irony of multitasking—that its overall goal, getting more done in less time, turns out to be chimerical. In reality, multitasking slows our thinking".

Another less hazardous appropriation is the act browsing. When we browse we are not really immersing ourselves into a task or topic, but we are rather enacting it with a mental idleness without attention to details or retention of knowledge. Ideally, instead of remembering what we read, we remember where we read it. It is kind of a *mental bookmark*. Whether this a necessary appropriation at times of information overload stands to question. Unquestionably this behavior is enabled by technology and possibly reinforced – I'm thinking of endless scrolling website, which automatically load new content on demand. The last example is life hacking. In a technological context hacking is the act of exposing (possibly exploiting) an engineering oversight or creating a short-cut to achieve the same result with less effort. Life hacking is the same principle. It is the pursuit od short cuts for better personal efficiency.

### Encoding 

Nowadays the ease of software development allows for rapid implementations of new ideas and concepts. A highly acclaimed circumstance which nevertheless has its pitfalls. Once an idea is implemented and reaches a certain threshold of distribution it becomes hard if not impossible to alter or adapt. Computer philosophy writer and computer scientist Jaron Lanier names this phenomenon **lock-in** in his 2010 manifesto [*You Are Not a Gadget*](http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/97779/you-are-not-a-gadget-by-jaron-lanier/). He argues that "the process of lock-in is like a wave gradually washing over the rulebook of life, culling the ambiguities of flexible thoughts as more and more thought structures are solidified into effectively permanent reality". (p.9)

His predominant example he refers to is the MIDI standard for notes in digital music and how it affects the ideation of new software and therefore also compositions. MIDI was developed by Dave Smith in the early 1980s. He conceived the standard when being faced with the problem of connecting a keyboard to a synthesizer. Dispite the fact the MIDI is a quite literal translation of the keys being pressed and released, MIDI became a standard format for musical notes in software. Whereas MIDI works well to encode the behavior of a keyboard, it fails to do so with other instruments, for example a saxophone. Nevertheless, since MIDI became an unquestioned standard for notes it also used to represent a saxophone in music software.

> "It takes only a tiny group of engineers to create technology that can shape the entire future of human experience with incredible speed. Therefore, crucial arguments about the human relationship with technology should take place between developers and users before such direct manipulations are designed." — Jaron Lanier (p.5f)

As he points out, Lanier is worried that the same mistake in terms of what a note is, is repeated nowadays in terms of what person is online. According to Lanier working with information technology automatically involves being engaged in social engeneering.

A concern in a similiar vein is shared by Eli Pariser in his 2011 book [*The Filter Bubble: What the Internet Is Hiding from You*](http://www.penguin.com/book/the-filter-bubble-by-eli-pariser/9780143121237). Pariser is credited with coining the term **filter bubble** in order to describe the effects algorithms have on our consumption of online media. Pariser critizises the intransparent nature by which for example Google generates search results or Facebook generates its news stream.

In summary, I believe it is worth questioning ideas and philosophies that are encoded into technology. What is true for musical notes is even more so true for our concept of time and how it is represented in technology.

### Inherence

In his TED talk about his book [What Technology Wants](http://kk.org/books/what-technology-wants/) WIRED magazine co-founder Kevin Kelly explains his view on the evolution of technology. The title seems to suggest a humanization of technology but Kelly is rather refering to the inherent qualities of technology. He goes on to point out that according to his observations technology evolves by the same standards nature does: ubiquity, diversity, specialization, complexity and socialization. According to Kelly there's proof for each of these trends in technology. Therefore he considers technology as the 7th [kingdom of nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_(biology)).

Another important concept in Kelly's analysis is what he refers to as the *infinite game*. He posits that culture is an accumulation of ideas. This implies that each idea is build upon the previous generation – as in cellular biology and genetics. In other words current technology is the plateau from which new technology is derived. But technology has also the advantage of skipping the current plateau and derive inspiration from all previous ideas. Therefore technology has an advantage over natural evolution where inappropriate adaptations to the environment simply cease to exist if they can not adapt to new circumstances.

From the standpoint that technology is modeled after natural observations and evolves by the same standards the hypothesis of the [technological singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity) becomes feasable. The singularity encapsulates the idea that technology will be able to reproduce and improve itself which eventually will result in a powerful superintelligence that far surpasses human intelligence. The author, scientist and self-proclaimed futurist Ray Kurzweil is a proponent of this theory. He argues that we are already working on the technology and predicts that the singularity will become reality by 2045.
