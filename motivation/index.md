# Motivation

The topic of this project was motivated by several encounters. Firstly it was inspired by my personal endeavour managing time by the means of computers. Secondly it was motivated by my increasing interest in how modern technology is affecting us personally and sociologically. And lastly it was influenced by my interest in the nature of time from a scientific perspective. These three strands culminated in the theme *Experiments on the entanglements of technology, time and the present moment*.

## Core themes

In the following paragraphs I'd like to introduce some themes that I defined as crucial for my project.

### Efficiency

Nowadays modern computer technology provides a multiplicity of options providing help to organize ones time. In its simplest form it appers as calendars, notifications and timers. Build upon these are a number of strategies, for example: [GTD (Getting Things Done)](http://gettingthingsdone.com/), [Pomodoro Technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/) or the [Eisenhower Matrix](http://www.eisenhower.me/). The techniques a then translated into software which makes them broadly available and oftentimes feasible. 

All these techniques aim to accomplish higher efficiency in order to 'save time'. The notion of 'saving time' alludes to notion of a sustainable work-life balance. The goal is to minimize the amount of 'work time' in order to gain 'life time'. In this scenario work and life are two competing forces, where work has a negative connotation, whereas life has positive connotations. From this perspective being effective at work is eligible, if not necessary in order to have time for life.

Generally technology that acts as a enhancement of or replacement for human labor is ingrained with the drive for efficiency. It is the promise to tilt the scale towards the life part of the equation. Computers especially try to fulfill the promise of less, more efficient work. Once computers where connected by a world-wide network and services became available detached from space, the dream of 'efficiency at the click of a mouse' was attainable, as this [early commercial by AOL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1npzZu83AfU) emphasizes.

Even when taking the commercial with a grain of salt I think it is worth asking how did we gain comparatively such an advantage in efficiency due to computers but somehow lacking the projected gains in time. If any theme is pravailing over the last few years, if not decades, than the perceived lack of time which we are trying to solve with ever more innovations – technological or enabled by technology. Are we stuck in cycle of efficiency which itself reaps the gains in time?

### Acceleration

Tightly coupled with efficiency is the perceived acceleration of life in general and time specifically. As pointed out by several writers and sociologists ...

### Relativity

The way we experience time is two-fold. On the one hand there is external time, or clock time, which structures our interaction with our environment. The contrast to that is internal time, which describes how we actually experience the flow of time. Whereas external time is linear, internal time is non-linear. We expereice this fact when in certain moments time seems to stand still, whereas in other moments time seems faster than usual. The experience of time is coupled to our psyche ...

### Appropriation

Appropriation of technological functionalities as human paradigms i.e. multi-tasking ...

### Encoding

... I think, when thoughts, ideas and philosophies are encoded into software their sociological exposure and long-term effects should be closely monitored and carefully analyzed. ...

## Cognitive Dissonance

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance

> It sounds like such a weirdly scientific term, but it’s broad reaching. I guess, for me, I was thinking about a place—because of the Internet—where there’s a lot of information out there, and we’re constantly bombarded by it, and it’s telling us many different things. Some of them are true, some of them are not. Some of them are true temporarily, and then change as science progresses. It’s just a mess of information. I think inherently, most people want to be good people, and being bombarded by all this is pushing them and pulling them in a bunch of different directions. You start to kind of lose touch with yourself by gaining all of this information. I think that’s where some of the dissonance comes from—wanting to do the right thing, but losing track of what that is for you as a human being.
